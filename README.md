# fbmessanger-native
[nw.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js) of https://www.messenger.com/ because I'm lazy.

# How it works
I built [nw.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js) loading up messenger.com, simple.

# How to use it
Open messenger.exe

Login like you would normal do at https://www.messenger.com/

Enjoy not having to open a browser, nativate to https://www.messenger.com/ and login.

Currently only built for windows, but it's made with [nw.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js) so you can no doubt build it for OSX or linux
